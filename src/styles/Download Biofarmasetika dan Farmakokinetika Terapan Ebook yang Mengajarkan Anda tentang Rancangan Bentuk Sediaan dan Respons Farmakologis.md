Biofarmasetika dan farmakokinetika terapan is a textbook written by Leon Shargel, Susanna Wu-Pong, and Andrew B. C. Yu, and translated by Fasich and Budi Suprapti. It was published by Airlangga University Press in 2012. The book covers the theoretical and practical applications of biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics, which are the study of how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body. The book also discusses the factors that affect drug bioavailability, bioequivalence, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenetics, and pharmacotherapy.

The book is intended for students and practitioners of pharmacy, medicine, and related health sciences who want to learn more about the principles and methods of biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics. The book provides clear explanations, examples, exercises, and case studies to illustrate the concepts and applications of the subject. The book also includes references to current literature and regulatory guidelines for further reading and research.
 
The book is available as an ebook download from various online sources. You can also access the full text of the book from the UNAIR Repository[^1^] or the Universitas Indonesia Library[^2^]. The book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to understand how drugs work in the body and how to optimize their therapeutic effects.
  
Biofarmasetika dan farmakokinetika terapan is divided into four parts. The first part introduces the basic concepts and definitions of biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics, such as drug solubility, dissolution, absorption, distribution, clearance, elimination, half-life, and steady state. The second part explains how to apply these concepts to the design and evaluation of dosage forms and drug delivery systems, such as tablets, capsules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, ointments, transdermal patches, and controlled-release formulations. The third part discusses how to use pharmacokinetic models and equations to describe and predict the pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs in the body, such as one-compartment model, two-compartment model, nonlinear kinetics, multiple dosing, and intravenous infusion. The fourth part covers the clinical applications of biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics, such as drug absorption enhancement, bioavailability and bioequivalence testing, drug-drug interactions, drug-food interactions, drug-disease interactions, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics.
 
Biofarmasetika dan farmakokinetika terapan is written in a clear and concise manner that makes it easy to follow and understand. The book uses diagrams, tables, graphs, and charts to illustrate the key points and data. The book also provides learning objectives, summaries, review questions, and answers at the end of each chapter to help the readers assess their comprehension and retention of the material. The book also includes appendices that contain useful information such as mathematical formulas, conversion factors, physicochemical constants, physiological parameters, and pharmacokinetic parameters of commonly used drugs.

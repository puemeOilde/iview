## How to Create a New Project and Import Assets
 
To create a new project in CelAction2D, go to File > New Project and enter a name for your project. You can also choose a resolution, frame rate, and duration for your project. Click OK to create your project.
 
To import assets into your project, go to File > Import > Images or File > Import > Sounds. You can import vector graphics (SVG), bitmap images (PNG, JPG, BMP), or sounds (WAV, MP3) into your project. You can also drag and drop files from your computer into the CelAction2D window.
 
Once you have imported your assets, you can see them in the Library panel on the left side of the screen. You can organize your assets into folders by right-clicking on them and selecting Move To Folder. You can also rename or delete your assets by right-clicking on them and selecting Rename or Delete.
 
## How to Rig and Animate Characters and Props
 
To rig and animate characters and props in CelAction2D, you need to use layers and bones. Layers are used to separate different parts of your character or prop, such as head, body, arms, legs, etc. Bones are used to connect and control the movement of your layers.
 
To create a layer, select an image from your library and drag it onto the Stage panel on the right side of the screen. You can resize, rotate, or move your layer by using the Transform tool on the toolbar at the top of the screen. You can also change the order of your layers by using the Layer Order tool on the toolbar.
 
To create a bone, select a layer and click on the Bone tool on the toolbar. Then click on two points on your layer where you want to place the bone. You can adjust the length and angle of your bone by dragging its ends. You can also add more bones to create a chain of bones.
 
To animate your character or prop, you need to use keyframes. Keyframes are used to record the position, rotation, scale, opacity, or color of your layers or bones at a certain point in time. To create a keyframe, select a layer or bone and move the Timeline slider at the bottom of the screen to where you want to place the keyframe. Then click on the Add Keyframe button on the

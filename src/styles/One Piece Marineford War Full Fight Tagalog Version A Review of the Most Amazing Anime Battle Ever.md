## Highlights of the One Piece Marineford War Full Fight Tagalog Version
  
The One Piece Marineford War Full Fight Tagalog Version has many highlights that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you feel the emotions of the characters. Here are some of the most notable ones:
  
- Luffy's entrance: Luffy arrives at Marineford with the help of his allies from Impel Down, the underwater prison where he rescued Ace. He makes a dramatic entrance by launching himself over the wall with a giant balloon and landing in the middle of the battlefield. He then declares his intention to save Ace and challenges the Marines and the Warlords of the Sea.
- Whitebeard's power: Whitebeard, also known as Edward Newgate, is the captain of the Whitebeard Pirates and one of the Four Emperors of the Sea. He is considered to be the strongest man in the world and the closest to One Piece. He has the power of the Tremor-Tremor Fruit, which allows him to create earthquakes and tsunamis with his fists. He uses his power to tilt the entire island of Marineford and cause massive destruction to the Marine forces. He also shows his immense strength and endurance by fighting against multiple enemies, even after being stabbed, shot, and burned.
- Ace's death: Ace is finally freed from his shackles by Mr. 3, one of Luffy's allies from Impel Down. He reunites with Luffy and thanks him for saving him. However, as they are about to escape, Admiral Akainu provokes Ace by insulting Whitebeard. Ace turns back to face Akainu and defends Whitebeard's honor. Akainu then attacks Ace with a powerful magma fist, but Luffy jumps in front of him to shield him. However, Ace pushes Luffy aside and takes the full impact of Akainu's attack, which pierces through his chest. Ace dies in Luffy's arms, telling him that he is grateful for being his brother and asking him to take care of himself.
- Whitebeard's final words: Whitebeard, despite being mortally wounded by Blackbeard and his crew, refuses to die until he sees Ace's body. He then uses his last breath to declare that One Piece is real and that a new era will begin when someone finds it. He also tells Blackbeard that he is not the one Roger is waiting for. He then dies standing up, with no scars on his back from running away. His death marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.
- Shanks' arrival: Shanks, also known as Red-Haired Shanks, is one of the Four Emperors of the Sea and Luffy's idol. He is also a former member of Roger's crew and a friend of Whitebeard. He arrives at Marineford with his crew after Whitebeard's death and stops the war by declaring that he will take care of the bodies of Whitebeard and Ace. He also stops Akainu from killing Coby, a young Marine who stood up to stop the war. He then offers to fight anyone who wants to continue fighting, but no one dares to challenge him. He then talks to Sengoku, the Fleet Admiral of the Marines, and convinces him to end the war.
